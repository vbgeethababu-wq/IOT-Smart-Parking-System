# IOT-Smart-Parking-System
Description: This project solves the problem of searching for parking spaces in cities. Using IR or Ultrasonic sensors, each parking slot detects whether it is occupied or free. The sensor data is sent via a microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32) to the cloud. Users can check a mobile app/web dashboard to see available slots in real-time.
